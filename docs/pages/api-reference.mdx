-  `query`: Query parameters to append to the URL.

-  `auth`: Authorization header value.

-  `bodySerializer`: Custom function to serialize the body object into a string.

-  `responseParser`: Custom function to parse the response string into an object.

-  `resultMode`: Mode of the result, can influence how results are handled or returned. (default: "all")

-  `cancelRedundantRequests`: If true, cancels previous unfinished requests to the same URL. (default: true)

-  `baseURL`: Base URL to be prepended to all request URLs.

-  `timeout`: Request timeout in milliseconds.

-  `defaultErrorMessage`: Default error message to use if none is provided from a response. (default: "Failed to fetch data from server!")

-  `throwOnError`: If true or the function returns true, throws errors instead of returning them.

-  `meta`: An optional field that can contain additional information about a request, which could be helpful in differentiating between different requests in a shared interceptor.

-  `onRequest`: Interceptor called just before the request is made, allowing for modifications or additional operations.

-  `onRequestError`: Interceptor called when an error occurs during the fetch request.

-  `onResponse`: Interceptor called when a successful response is received from the API.
