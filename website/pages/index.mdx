# Introduction

CallApi is an extra-lightweight wrapper around the Fetch API, designed to simplify making HTTP requests. It allows you to use familiar Fetch API syntax while offering additional options for convenience.

Just like Fetch, it takes a `url` and a `request` options object, but with added functionality to streamline common tasks. Check out the [API Reference](/api-reference) for a detailed look at each option.

With CallApi, handling responses is effortless. Instead of manually parsing the response, you can destructure both `data` and `error` in a single step, making your code cleaner and more efficient:

```js copy
const { data, error } = await callApi("url", fetchOptions);
```

You can still pass the same request options as you would with Fetch API, ensuring compatibility with your existing code. Additionally, if you need access to the full response, it's available too:

```js copy
const { data, error, response } = await callApi("url", fetchOptions);
```
