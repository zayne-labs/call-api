CallApi can be installed using popular package managers or used directly in the browser through a CDN.

### Using npm (recommended)

To install CallApi using npm, run the following command:

```package-install
npm install @zayne-labs/callapi
```

Then, import CallApi into your project:

```ts
import { callApi } from "@zayne-labs/callapi";
```

### Without npm

To use CallApi without npm, import it directly into your JavaScript files via a CDN by using a script tag with the `type="module"` attribute:

```html
<script type="module">
	import { callApi } from "https://esm.run/@zayne-labs/callapi";
</script>
```

If you want to use a specific version, you can specify it in the URL like this:

```html
<script type="module">
	import { callApi } from "https://esm.run/@zayne-labs/callapi@0.7.7";
</script>
```
