CallApi allows you to generate authorization headers conveniently by using an `auth` property.

## Bearer

The bearer authorization is used to add a bearer token to the request. Since this is the more commonly used authorization, passing a string to the `auth` property will generate a `Bearer` Authorization header. You can also pass an object with a `bearer` property to achieve the same result.

```ts title="api.ts"
import { createFetchClient } from "@zayne-labs/callapi";

// Passing a string
const callBackendApi = createFetchClient({
	baseURL: "http://localhost:3000",
	auth: "my-token", // [!code highlight]
});

// Passing an object
const result = await callBackendApi("/users/123", {
	auth: {
		bearer: "my-token",
	},
});
```

The above is equivalent to writing the following with Fetch:

```ts
fetch("http://localhost:3000/users/123", {
	headers: { Authorization: `Bearer my-token` },
});
```

You can also pass a function that returns a string.

```ts title="api.ts"
import { createFetchClient } from "@zayne-labs/callapi";

const callBackendApi = createFetchClient({
	baseURL: "http://localhost:3000",
});

const result = callBackendApi("/users/123", {
	auth: {
		bearer: () => authStore.getToken(),
	},
});
```

<Callout type="info">
	The function will be called only once when the request is made. If it returns undefined, the header will
	not be added to the request.
</Callout>

## Token

This is similar to the bearer authorization, but the header prefix is named `Token` instead of `Bearer`. To use it, you can pass an object with a `token` property.

```ts title="api.ts"
import { createFetchClient } from "@zayne-labs/callapi";

const callBackendApi = createFetchClient({
	baseURL: "http://localhost:3000",
	auth: {
		token: "my-token",
	},
});

const result = await callBackendApi("/users/123");
```

The above is equivalent to writing the following with Fetch:

```ts
fetch("http://localhost:3000/users/123", {
	headers: { Authorization: `Token my-token` },
});
```

## Basic

The basic authorization is used to add a basic authentication to the request. The username and password are added to the `Authorization` header.

```ts title="api.ts"
import { createFetchClient } from "@zayne-labs/callapi";

const callBackendApi = createFetchClient({
	baseURL: "http://localhost:3000",
	auth: {
		type: "Basic",
		username: "my-username",
		password: "my-password",
	},
});
```

## Custom

To use a custom authorization not supported by default, you can pass an object with a `type` property set to `Custom` together with `prefix` and `value` properties.

```ts title="api.ts"
import { createFetchClient } from "@zayne-labs/callapi";

const callBackendApi = createFetchClient({
	baseURL: "http://localhost:3000",
	auth: {
		type: "Custom",
		prefix: "SomePrefix",
		value: "my-token",
	},
});

const result = await callBackendApi("/users/123");
```

The above is equivalent to writing the following with Fetch:

```ts
fetch("http://localhost:3000/users/123", {
	headers: { Authorization: `SomePrefix my-token` },
});
```
