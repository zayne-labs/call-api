- All [regular fetch options](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/RequestInit) are supported as is, with only body extended to support more types.

- `body`: Optional body of the request, can be an object or any other supported body type.

- `query`: Query parameters to append to the URL.

- `auth`: Authorization header value.

- `bodySerializer`: Custom function to serialize the body object into a string.

- `responseParser`: Custom function to parse the response string into an object.

- `resultMode`: Mode of the result, can influence how results are handled or returned. (default: "all")

- `cancelRedundantRequests`: If true, cancels previous unfinished requests to the same URL. (default: true)

- `baseURL`: Base URL to be prepended to all request URLs.

- `timeout`: Request timeout in milliseconds.

- `defaultErrorMessage`: Default error message to use if none is provided from a response. (default: "Failed to fetch data from server!")

- `throwOnError`: If true or the function returns true, throws errors instead of returning them.

- `responseType`: Expected response type, affects how response is parsed. (default: "json")

- `retries`: Number of retry attempts for failed requests. (default: 0)

- `retryDelay`: Delay between retries in milliseconds. (default: 500)

- `retryMethods`: HTTP methods that are allowed to retry. (default: ["GET", "POST"])

- `meta`: An optional field that can contain additional information about a request, which could be helpful in differentiating between different requests in a shared interceptor.

- `onRequest`: Interceptor called just before the request is made, allowing for modifications or additional operations.

- `onRequestError`: Interceptor called when an error occurs during the fetch request.

- `onResponse`: Interceptor called when a successful response is received from the API.

- `onResponseError`: Interceptor called when an error response is received from the API.
